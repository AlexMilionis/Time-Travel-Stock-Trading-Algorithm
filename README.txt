Developed an algorithm to simulate stock trading in the past using historical stock data from the New York Stock Exchange. The project aimed to maximize profits by leveraging knowledge of historical stock prices, implementing strategies such as buy-low and sell-high across multiple stocks. Advanced techniques were applied to identify optimal intraday trades, incorporating opening and closing prices as well as daily price fluctuations. The algorithm was further optimized to ensure trades did not exceed 10% of the daily trading volume, and sequential transactions were executed efficiently to maintain a realistic simulation. The results showed significant profit margins over a series of 1,000 and 1,000,000 trades, demonstrating the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness.
